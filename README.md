# 🌸 Welcome to my page 🌸

##### My name is Kayla Karmanos, and I am an English student at the University of Pennsylvania. This fall 2024, I was enrolled in *Introduction to Digital Humanities*, where I had the opportunity to delve into archival work and humanistic research for the first time. Here, I reflect on the projects I engaged in throughout this semester and detail my plans to engage with similar content in the future. Enjoy!
