## My journey through an Introduction to Digital Humanities

### Prior Expectations

My motivation to take this class stemmed from a desire to do something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù while still remaining in the realm of my English major curriculum. Given my complete lack of coding experience and intimidation toward the subject, I was intrigued by this course‚Äôs description that no prior experience was needed. My tech knowledge practically consisted of creating a Weebly website for an 8th grade history project‚Äîan assignment I remembered enjoying, especially in terms of curating the layout and design to display my research to the public. I thus enrolled in ENGL 1650 with no idea what to expect, eager to test the waters and broaden the scope of my major‚Äôs requirements. When friends inquired about my schedule and, consequently, what this class would entail, I often gave a blurb about learning basic coding for humanities projects‚Äînot really knowing what that meant to me. To my surprise, digital humanities has proven to be broader and more flexible than I expected, drawing on creativity and artistry to represent the humanity of data.

### The First Few Weeks

The humanity behind data has proven to be the recurring theme in this course‚Äôs content. From the very beginning of the class, we engaged with readings and lectures like Giorgia Lupi‚Äôs [‚ÄúFinding Humanity in Data‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ) discussion, which provided a solid foundation for our emphasis on humans as the driving force behind modern technology. Lupi‚Äôs account of a site-specific visualization of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern art especially piqued my interest. This project provided insight into the ways art has been used to model and express humanistic data in more personal and interactive formats. I began to note connections between humanistic research and art and to discover the capacity of artwork to communicate powerful, data-driven messages to the public. 

Our discussions also often centered around ethical challenges in dealing with data that represents real people. These issues appear especially in the [Digital Panopticon project](https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/The_Ethics_of_Digital_Data_on_Convict_Lives), a project that reproduces nineteenth-century criminal records. As the project recreates the records, it reinforces nineteenth-century stereotypes while reducing convicts to their criminal records. The project site details its various ethical debates, all of which have no ‚Äúeasy answers.‚Äù Discussions of complex research projects like this have helped me to understand the nuance of humanistic data, of which there are no black and white ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answers, instead only ethical debates. 

### Visit to Eastern State Penitentiary

Following weeks of discussion and reading on the ethics, challenges, and functions of digital humanities, we had the opportunity to visit Eastern State Penitentiary, prior to conducting research for [Printing in Prisons](printinginprisons.org). This field trip set the stage for our subsequent multimedia essay project by giving me a firsthand account of the visceral experience of existing within the prison. Touring the prison on my own with audio tour headphones helped to encapsulate me in the solitude of the prison‚Äôs history and to empathize with the people who spent so much of their lives incarcerated in the space. Seeing the crumbling walls and noting the smell of mildew in the air was an inescapable reminder of the rich history of the prison and the generations of read people who had lived within its confinement.
