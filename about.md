## A reflection of my journey through Introduction to Digital Humanities

### Prior Expectations

My motivation to take this class stemmed from a desire to do something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù while still remaining in the realm of my English major curriculum. Given my complete lack of coding experience and intimidation toward the subject, I was intrigued by this course‚Äôs description that no prior experience was needed. My tech knowledge practically consisted of creating a Weebly website for an 8th grade history project‚Äîan assignment I remembered enjoying, especially in terms of curating the layout and design to display my research to the public. I thus enrolled in ENGL 1650 with no idea what to expect, eager to test the waters and broaden the scope of my major‚Äôs requirements. When friends inquired about my schedule and, consequently, what this class would entail, I often gave a blurb about learning basic coding for humanities projects‚Äînot really knowing what that meant to me. To my surprise, digital humanities has proven to be broader and more flexible than I expected, drawing on creativity and artistry to represent the humanity of data.

### The First Few Weeks

The humanity behind data has proven to be the recurring theme in this course‚Äôs content. From the very beginning of the class, we engaged with readings and lectures like Giorgia Lupi‚Äôs [‚ÄúFinding Humanity in Data‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ) discussion, which provided a solid foundation for our emphasis on humans as the driving force behind modern technology. Lupi‚Äôs account of a site-specific visualization of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern art especially piqued my interest. This project provided insight into the ways art has been used to model and express humanistic data in more personal and interactive formats. I began to note connections between humanistic research and art and to discover the capacity of artwork to communicate powerful, data-driven messages to the public. 

Our discussions also often centered around ethical challenges in dealing with data that represents real people. These issues appear especially in the [Digital Panopticon project](https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/The_Ethics_of_Digital_Data_on_Convict_Lives), a project that reproduces nineteenth-century criminal records. As the project recreates the records, it reinforces nineteenth-century stereotypes while reducing convicts to their criminal records. The project site details its various ethical debates, all of which have no ‚Äúeasy answers.‚Äù Discussions of complex research projects like this have helped me to understand the nuance of humanistic data, of which there are no black and white ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answers, instead only ethical debates. 

### Visit to Eastern State Penitentiary

Following weeks of discussion and reading on the ethics, challenges, and functions of digital humanities, we had the opportunity to visit [Eastern State Penitentiary](https://www.easternstate.org/), prior to conducting research for the [Printing in Prisons](https://printinginprisons.org) Project. This field trip set the stage for our multimedia essays by giving me a firsthand account of the visceral experience of existing within the prison. Touring the prison on my own with audio tour headphones helped to encapsulate me in the solitude of the prison‚Äôs history and to empathize with the people who spent so much of their lives incarcerated in the space. Seeing the crumbling walls and noting the smell of mildew in the air was an inescapable reminder of the rich history of the prison and the generations of read people who had lived within its confinement. Immersing myself in this environment heavily informed my research, provided jumping-off points for topic ideas, and helping me to recognize and understand the realness of the history we were dealing with. 

### Creating a Multimedia Essay

Given my love for art, I knew immediately that I wanted to investigate art-making in prison in some capacity as part of my multimedia essay. The colorful graphics of the Eastern Echo printed at Eastern State especially stood out to me‚Äîmost notably, the vibrant blue cover illustration of the Summer 1965 edition of the publication. With the convenience of our dataset, I was able to locate the image in the spreadsheet, along with the subsequent credits page, which noted the staff illustrator of the edition: ‚ÄúS.R. Cantoral.‚Äù

Searching first through the Printing in Prisons dataset, I located every space where Cantoral was mentioned‚Äîdiscovering him to be an involved individual within the prison community. An avid baseball player, dental employee, artist, and writer, Socrates Cantoral seemed to engage with nearly every program the penitentiary had to offer. When I discovered an article titled ‚ÄúA Profile of Socrates Cantoral,‚Äù I knew I‚Äôd hit a jackpot‚Äîthis feature article provided clear insight into Cantoral‚Äôs engagements in the prison, his life before Eastern State, and it provided powerful quotes that spoke to his own desire to repent and reform himself under the prison‚Äôs 

### Extracurricular Workshops

The assignment to attend workshops at Penn and in the greater Philadelphia area were enjoyable and insightful opportunities to venture beyond my comfort zone and attend something solo. For my Penn workshop, I visited the Common Press in the Fisher Fine Arts library‚Äîmy first time in that space, and my first time seeing antique printing presses firsthand. Our instructor, Erica, demonstrated the functions of each, beginning with the handpress, the oldest model. Seeing and touching these machines and their components‚Äîespecially the letter stamps of varying sizes, which were surprisingly made of a solid metal material‚Äîgave me a taste of the tasks these 

### Critical Making Collaboration

I was surprised to find that digital humanities is much broader and more flexible than I expected‚Äîthis was something especially salient in the midst of our [Critical Making Project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ugMWW4K39iqshgfNomaZctrOOLxqo7CDgSkNeYDUQSo/edit?usp=sharing), where we had the chance to create a meaningful object as a representation of data from Eastern State. The project was broad and full of possibility‚Äîit felt like an assignment from a fine arts class, but one with foundation in concrete research. The process of working together to create a laser-cut word count histogram with my group was a lesson in itself‚Äîas we built off of each other‚Äôs ideas and improvised throughout the actual design process, we watched as our collective thinking morphed into an object charged with meaning.
