## My journey through an Introduction to Digital Humanities

### Prior Expectations

My motivation to take this class stemmed from a desire to do something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù while still remaining in the realm of my English major curriculum. Given my complete lack of coding experience and intimidation toward the subject, I was intrigued by this course‚Äôs description that no prior experience was needed. My tech knowledge practically consisted of creating a Weebly website for an 8th grade history project‚Äîan assignment I remembered enjoying, especially in terms of curating the layout and design to display my research to the public. I thus enrolled in ENGL 1650 with no idea what to expect, eager to test the waters and broaden the scope of my major‚Äôs requirements. When friends inquired about my schedule and, consequently, what this class would entail, I often gave a blurb about learning basic coding for humanities projects‚Äînot really knowing what that meant to me. To my surprise, digital humanities has proven to be broader and more flexible than I expected, drawing on creativity and artistry to represent the humanity of data.

### The First Few Weeks

The humanity behind data has proven to be the recurring theme behind this course‚Äôs content. From the very beginning of the class, we engaged with readings and lectures like Giorgia Lupi‚Äôs [‚ÄúFinding Humanity in Data‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ) discussion, which provided a solid foundation for our emphasis on humans as the driving force behind modern technology. Lupi‚Äôs account of a site-specific visualization of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern art piqued my interest, giving me

### Critical Making Collaboration

I was surprised to find that digital humanities is much broader and more flexible than I expected‚Äîthis was something especially salient in the midst of our [Critical Making Project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ugMWW4K39iqshgfNomaZctrOOLxqo7CDgSkNeYDUQSo/edit?usp=sharing), where we had the chance to create a meaningful object as a representation of data from Eastern State. The project was broad and full of possibility‚Äîit felt like an assignment from a fine arts class, but one with foundation in concrete research. The process of working together to create a laser-cut word count histogram with my group was a lesson in itself‚Äîas we built off of each other‚Äôs ideas and improvised throughout the actual design process, we watched as our collective thinking morphed into an object charged with meaning.
