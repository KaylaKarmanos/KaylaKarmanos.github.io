## My journey through an Introduction to Digital Humanities

### Prior Expectations

My motivation to take this class stemmed from a desire to do something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù while still remaining in the realm of my English major curriculum. Given my complete lack of coding experience and intimidation toward the subject, I was intrigued by this course‚Äôs description that no prior experience was needed. My tech knowledge practically consisted of creating a Weebly website for an 8th grade history project‚Äîan assignment I remembered enjoying, especially in terms of curating the layout and design to display my research to the public. I thus enrolled in ENGL 1650 with no idea what to expect, eager to test the waters and broaden the scope of my major‚Äôs requirements. When friends inquired about my schedule and, consequently, what this class would entail, I often gave a blurb about learning basic coding for humanities projects‚Äînot really knowing what that meant to me. To my surprise, digital humanities has proven to be broader and more flexible than I expected, drawing on creativity and artistry to represent the humanity of data.

### The First Few Weeks

The humanity behind data has proven to be the recurring theme in this course‚Äôs content. From the very beginning of the class, we engaged with readings and lectures like Giorgia Lupi‚Äôs [‚ÄúFinding Humanity in Data‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ) discussion, which provided a solid foundation for our emphasis on humans as the driving force behind modern technology. Lupi‚Äôs account of a site-specific visualization of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern art especially piqued my interest. This project provided insight into the ways art has been used to model and express humanistic data in more personal and interactive formats. I began to note connections between humanistic research and art and to discover the capacity of artwork to communicate powerful, data-driven messages to the public. 

Our discussions also more or less centered around ethical challenges in dealing with data that represents real people. These issues appear especially in the [Digital Panopticon project[(https://www.digitalpanopticon.org/The_Ethics_of_Digital_Data_on_Convict_Lives), a project that reproduces nineteenth-century criminal records. As the project recreates the records, it reinforces nineteenth-century stereotypes while defining convicts by their criminal records‚Äîthus raising debate over exploitation of the misery of human beings. The project site itself details in depth its various ethical debates, all of which have no ‚Äúeasy answers.‚Äù Discussions of complex research projects like this have helped me to understand the nuance of humanistic data‚Äîof which there are no black and white ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù answers, instead only ethical debates. 

### Visit to Eastern State Penitentiary

Following weeks of discussion and reading on the ethics, challenges, and function of digital humanities, we had the opportunity to visit Eastern State Penitentiary, prior to conducting research for [Printing in Prisons](printinginprisons.org)


### Extracurricular Workshops



### Creating a Multimedia Essay



### Critical Making Collaboration

I was surprised to find that digital humanities is much broader and more flexible than I expected‚Äîthis was something especially salient in the midst of our [Critical Making Project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ugMWW4K39iqshgfNomaZctrOOLxqo7CDgSkNeYDUQSo/edit?usp=sharing), where we had the chance to create a meaningful object as a representation of data from Eastern State. The project was broad and full of possibility‚Äîit felt like an assignment from a fine arts class, but one with foundation in concrete research. The process of working together to create a laser-cut word count histogram with my group was a lesson in itself‚Äîas we built off of each other‚Äôs ideas and improvised throughout the actual design process, we watched as our collective thinking morphed into an object charged with meaning.
