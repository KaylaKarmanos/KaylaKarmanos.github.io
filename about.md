### Reflecting on my experience in Introduction to Digital Humanities

The overarching theme of this class was an exploration of the humans behind data, stripping numbers and stats back to the core of the people they represent. From the very beginning of the class, we consumed content like Giorgia Lupi’s [“Finding Humanity in Data”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ) lecture, which provided a solid foundation for our emphasis on humans as the driving force behind technology, even as it seems so disconnected and robotic in its modern standpoint. Lupi’s numeration of various digital humanities projects, such as a site-specific visualization of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern art, piqued my interest, tapping into my passions for art and the humanities while showing me possible connections to technology, or new and innovative ways to model data in creative, artistic ways.
