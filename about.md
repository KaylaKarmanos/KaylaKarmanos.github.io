## My journey through an Introduction to Digital Humanities

### Prior Expectations

My motivation to take this class stemmed from a desire to do something ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù while still remaining in the realm of my English major curriculum. Given my complete lack of coding experience and intimidation toward the subject, I was intrigued by this course‚Äôs description that no prior experience was needed. My ‚Äútech knowledge‚Äù consisted of an experience in creating a Weebly website for an 8th grade history project‚Äîan assignment I remembered enjoying, especially in terms of creating the layout and design to display my research to the public. Similarly, I found this course to address my passions for both art and humanities, revealing innovative modes of representing data to expand beyond raw numbers and attempt to encapsulate the human experience.

I enrolled in ENGL 1650 with no idea what to expect, eager to test the waters and broaden the scope of my major requirements. When friends inquired about my schedule and, consequently, what this class would entail, I often gave a blurb about learning basic coding for humanities projects‚Äînot really knowing what that meant to me. To my surprise, digital humanities has proven to be broader and more flexible than I expected. I have come to realize the creativity of humanistic data representation and to note ample ways to intertwine artistry with numbers and technology‚Äîdisciplines I once considered mutually exclusive. 

### The First Few Weeks

The humanity behind data has proven to be the recurring theme behind this course‚Äôs content. From the very beginning of the class, we engaged with readings and lectures like Giorgia Lupi‚Äôs [‚ÄúFinding Humanity in Data‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYRhCZ0vvFQ) discussion, which provided a solid foundation for our emphasis on humans as the driving force behind technology, even as it may seem so disconnected and robotic in its modern standpoint. Lupi‚Äôs numeration of various digital humanities projects, such as a site-specific visualization of an exhibition at the Museum of Modern art, piqued my interest, tapping into my passions for art and the humanities. I remember being inspired and interested in exploring more ways of representing and engaging with data through art‚Äîrather than more vapid modes of representing data that fail to acknowledge the human experience of the topic.

### Critical Making Collaboration

I was surprised to find that digital humanities is much broader and more flexible than I expected‚Äîthis was something especially salient in the midst of our [Critical Making Project](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ugMWW4K39iqshgfNomaZctrOOLxqo7CDgSkNeYDUQSo/edit?usp=sharing), where we had the chance to create a meaningful object as a representation of data from Eastern State. The project was broad and full of possibility‚Äîit felt like an assignment from a fine arts class, but one with foundation in concrete research. The process of working together to create a laser-cut word count histogram with my group was a lesson in itself‚Äîas we built off of each other‚Äôs ideas and improvised throughout the actual design process, we watched as our
