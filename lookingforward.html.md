### Actions Steps after my First Exposure to Digital Humanities

1. Attending Workshops at Education Commons: Embroidery

While researching workshop options to fulfill my workshop assignment, I was excited to see options for embroidery workshops at Education Commons. I have a minimal sowing background and have always wanted to be able to embroider my own clothes by hand--embroidery is a skill I hoped to master during the pandemic, but which proved much harder to learn on my own. Learning the functions of Education Commons' embroidery machines would be a great resource to have, which would help me elevate my clothing or make things for friends and family.

It was fascinating to see the ease with which my Critical Making group and I learned how to use the laser-cutter---I hope to feel the same about other machinery in the makerspace which seems so intimidating.
   
2. Utilizing Github for Portfolio uses

As a passionate artist throughout high school, I compiled my artwork to submit portfolios for my college applications. However, as I grow as a student and venture more into the professional world, I need to create a professional-looking portfolio site for job and internship applications in art-related fields. Github would be a simple and effective platform to create a site for myself. I enjoyed cultivating this Github site using basic markdown syntax--I can recognize now that I have some capacity for web design and coding, if not at a base level. 
  
3. Attending local Philly workshops

The Philly workshop assignment forced me to go beyond Penn and escape the bubble. I reveled in the chance to create alongside a group of creative-minded adults, and I feel proud to wear a t-shirt that I designed and screen printed from scratch. The Tool Library
