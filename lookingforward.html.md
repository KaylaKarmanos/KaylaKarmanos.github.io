## Actions Steps after my First Exposure to Digital Humanities

My time spent in this class has not only taught me about Digital Humanities but also about available resources on campus and in the greater Philadelphia area. 

### Attending Workshops at Education Commons: Embroidery

While researching workshop options to fulfill my workshop assignment, I was excited to see options for embroidery workshops at Education Commons. I have a minimal hand-sowing background and have always wanted to be able to embroider my own clothes by hand. Embroidery is a skill I hoped to master during the pandemic, but which proved much harder to learn on my own. Unfortunately, registration for the class that fit my schedule was full, so I pursued other options to fulfill my Penn workshop requirement.

Learning the functions of Education Commons' embroidery machines would be a great resource to have; it would help me elevate my clothing or make things for friends and family. I knew nothing of Education Commons prior to this class---now I know I have free access to high-end technology which I can use to make personal projects, whether that's with a laser-cutter, 3D printer, or embroidery machine. It was fascinating to see the ease with which my Critical Making group and I learned how to use the laser-cutter; I hope to feel the same about other machinery in the makerspace which seems so intimidating to me now.
   
### Utilizing Github for Portfolio uses

As a passionate artist throughout high school, I compiled my artwork to submit portfolios for my college applications. However, as I venture more into the professional world, I need to create a professional-looking portfolio site for applications in art-related positions. Github would be a simple and effective platform to create a site for myself. I enjoyed cultivating this Github site using basic markdown syntax---troubleshooting the layout and watching the site come together felt rewarding. I can recognize now that I have some capacity for web design and coding, if not at a base level. Github feels much more accessible that other platforms, and I am intrigued by the idea of learning more about markdown syntax.
  
### Attending local Philly workshops

The Philly workshop assignment forced me to go beyond Penn and escape the bubble through a screenprinting class at the West Philly Tool Library. I reveled in the chance to spend time with a group of creative-minded adults, and I feel proud to wear a t-shirt I designed and screen printed from scratch. The Tool Library offers a multitude of other interesting classes that I would enjoy---especially sewing machine basics. I have always wanted to master the sewing machine ever since I made a pillow case with my Home Economics class in seventh grade. The Tool library is an affordable, accessible resource I would not have discovered without this assignment. Going forward, I am subscribed to their email list and will keep an eye out for relevant and exciting workshop opportunities.
